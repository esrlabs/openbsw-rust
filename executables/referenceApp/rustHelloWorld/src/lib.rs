//! A simple "Hello World" Rust library demonstrating Rust integration with OpenBSW.
//!
//! This crate provides a minimal example of how to expose Rust functions to C++ code
//! in the OpenBSW build system.
//!
//! # FFI Approach
//!
//! This example uses the **manual FFI approach**, where:
//! - Rust functions are marked with `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"`
//! - A corresponding C/C++ header file is written by hand
//!
//! This is not the only way to expose Rust to C++. Alternative approaches include:
//! - **[cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen)**: Automatically generates C/C++ headers from Rust code
//! - **[cxx](https://cxx.rs/)**: Provides safe bidirectional interop between Rust and C++
//!
//! The manual approach was chosen here for simplicity.
//!
//! # Target Compatibility
//!
//! Uses `no_std` for compatibility with both POSIX and embedded targets.
